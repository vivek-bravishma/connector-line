Add Channel Provider
 
To begin Custom Messaging integration, an Element representing the Custom Messaging Connector needs to be added in the Avaya Experience Platform™ Administration. The connector is the source of channel for Avaya Experience Platform™, hence it is also referred as the Channel Provider. To add a Custom Messaging Connector Element, follow the steps below
 
    Go to your Avaya Experience Platform™ Administration application
    Sign in as an Account Administrator
    Navigate to "Element Inventory" and select "New" > "Digital Connector" > "Messaging"
    Provide details about your Messaging Connector
 
    Name - Any name that you would like to give to your new Messaging Connector Element
    Callback URL - A callback URL hosted by your connector to receive events related to integrations when they are created, updated or deleted by Account Administrator for this Element. This is an optional field. If the callback URL is provided, the operations on the integrations will fail if the callback request fails. Details about the information sent as part of the callback request is provided here
 
    Click "Save" once you have filled the data.
    Your new Messaging Connector Element will appear in the list of Elements.
    You can edit the Messaging Connector Element and copy the "Channel Provider Id" which was automatically generated by the system to uniquely identify this Element. This Id must be used to fill the value of the field channelProviderId which is required while subscribing to Digital Notifications and also send messages into Avaya Experience Platform™.
 
If your business needs integrations with multiple Providers and you wish to handle this using separate Connectors, you can create multiple Custom Messaging Elements representing each Connector. The number of Custom Messaging Connectors that can be created for an Account is limited to 5.
Create and Configure Custom Messaging Integration
 
Once the Custom Messaging Connector Element is created, the next step is to create an Integration for it. An Integration represents the entry point for messaging interactions related to a business function. Various configurations that define how a messaging interaction will be treated in the contact center, like routing queues, routing attributes, orchestration workflows, automated apps and context data matching rules, are associated with an Integration. For a Custom Messaging Connector Element, a maximum of 10 Integrations can be created to represent various business functions. To create a Custom Messaging Integration, follow the below steps
 
    Go to your Avaya Experience Platform™ Administration application
    Sign in as an Account Administrator
    Navigate to "Channels" and select "Messaging"
    From the "Integration Type" dropdown, select "Custom Messaging"
    A second drop down with the name "Providers" will appear. Select the Custom Messaging Connector Element that you had created in the previous section.
    Once you select the Element, a "Create Integration" button will appear. Once you click on this button, you will be redirected to "New Integration" page where you can provide the "Name" of Integration.
    Click on the "Save" button, to create the new Integration which will be visible within the list of Integrations
    From this list of Integrations, you can select the Integration and "Edit" it to change the name or copy the "Integration Id" which was automatically generated by the system to uniquely identify this Integration. This Id will be required to be passed as businessAccountName in the API to send messages into Avaya Experience Platform™.
    In the list of Integrations, you can also select the Integration and "Configure Routing Settings" to define the business rules for this Integration.
